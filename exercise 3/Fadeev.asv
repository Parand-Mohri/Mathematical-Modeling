%% Algorithm for computing transfer function from state-space representation
%    Inputs: state-space representation by specifying A, B, C, D
%    outputs: coefficients of the numerator polynomial b of transfer function,
%    the coefficients of the denominator polynomial a of transfer function
%    and a cell array S containing S1 through Sn
S1 = eye(lenght(A))
S2 = A * S1 + a1*eye(length(A))
S3 = A * S2 + a2*eye (length(A))
end
